To start:
Open Image_converter_combined
In the dialog box that opens click browse beside the first text box and select an image
Click the second browse button and select the output folder
In the box beside Scale, input the percentage you want the image to be scaled to, a higher nunmber is higher detail but takes longer.
Wait a bit
Open the file named the same as your initial image with ascii.txt on the end
Enjoy
